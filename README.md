# Interactive Reservation System 
The aim of the project is to develop a web-application that focuses on taking bookings for a club. User’s engagement was the key point throughout the development process hence the interface kept at primary level, yet efficient. For the application, a vast number of concepts and techniques are used in conjunction, to make it robust, work efficiently and with easy extensibility. The web-application presents extensive use of software architecture concept MVC; model, view, controller for logical structure of the application and to ensure it adheres to best practices in this field.
